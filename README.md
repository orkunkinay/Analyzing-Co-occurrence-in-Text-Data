# Analyzing Co-occurrence in Text Data Using Machine Learning

## Introduction
This repository contains the implementation of an experiment aimed at analyzing co-occurrence patterns in text data. The primary goal is to explore the relationships and patterns between different terms within a corpus. Corpus can be changed to see the results of different text data.

## Experiment Overview
The experiment involves:
- Data preprocessing and exploration
- Calculation of co-occurrence matrices
- Analysis of co-occurrence patterns
- Visualization of results

## Installation
To run this project, you'll need to have the following dependencies installed:
- Python 3.8 or higher
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
